Many hospitals in low income contries struggle to provide post-operative care due to lack of proper medical supplies, such as blood pressure cuffs and stethoscopes.  Many hospitals in the United States buy new equipment before the supplies being replaced is at the end of its life.  Our project will connect these medicals supplies about to be retired in the USA to hospitals around the world that could still put it to good use.
